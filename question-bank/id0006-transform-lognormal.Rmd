A positive random variable $X$ is said to have a lognormal distribution if $\log X$  has a normal distribution.  Find the pdf of the lognormal distribution^[Some background: Many naturally occurring random variables are non-negative, but often fit a normal model very well. Even though theoretically a normal variable can take negative values, if its mean is sufficiently positive, the chance of negative values can be negligibly small. However there are also naturally occurring situations with a continuous random variable with sufficient probability of taking values close to zero, so that assuming a symmetric distribution, including normal, is not appropriate. Sometimes for such positive random variables, the distribution of the log of the variable follows a normal model.].
