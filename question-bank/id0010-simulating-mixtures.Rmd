Let $Z$ be a discrete Possion mixture distribution $Z = XY_{1} + (1-X)Y_{2}$ where $X$ is Bernoulli with probability of success $p=0.4$, and $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are Poisson random variables with means $\lambda_{1} = 4$ and $\lambda_{2}= 10$.

(a) Write a function to simulate realisations from this distribution. Use simulation to estimate the mean and variance of $Z$, and compare to the theoretical mean and variance.

(b) Write a function for the probability mass fucntion (pmf) for the distribution of $Z$. Plot a histogram of simulated random variables with the pmf overlayed.

(c) Write a generic function which can simulate a discrete Possion mixture distribution with $k$ components. It should have arguments for a probability vector,^[The probability of each component.] $\boldsymbol{p}$, and vector of $\lambda_{i}$'s^[The mean of each component.], $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$. Test your function by plotting the historgram for a discrete mixture with $\boldsymbol{p} = (0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.6)$ and $\boldsymbol{\lambda} = (1,4,8,15)$.
