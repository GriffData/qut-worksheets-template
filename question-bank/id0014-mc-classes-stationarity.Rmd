The following matrix has three classes: two recurrent classes and one transient class.

$$
P = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\frac{1}{4} & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{4} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 &\frac{1}{3} & 0 & \frac{2}{3} \\
0 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & 0 & \frac{1}{3} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 &\frac{3}{4} & 0 & \frac{1}{4}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
(a) Determine the classes (i.e. which state belongs in which class and the type of classes) and the period of the recurrent classes.

(b) Does there exist a unique stationary distribution? Explain your answer.

(c) Determine the probability of absorbing from each state in the transient class into each of the recurrent classes, given that you start in a particular state of the transient class.
