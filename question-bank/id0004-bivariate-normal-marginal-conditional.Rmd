Let $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ have a joint normal probability distribution^[In other words a bivariate normal distribution.] given by:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{c} 
X_{1}\\
X_{2} 
\end{array}\right] \sim
\text{N}\left(
\left[\begin{array}{c} 
0\\
0 
\end{array}\right],
\left[\begin{array}{cc} 
\sigma^{2}_{1} & \rho\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\\
\rho\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2} & \sigma^{2}_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\right)
$$

(a) Show that the marginal distribution $X_{1}$ is normally distributed.
(b) Show that the conditional distribution $X_{2}~\vert~X_{1}$ is normally distributed.
