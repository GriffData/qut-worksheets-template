Let $(X,Y)$ be a discrete bivariate random variable with probabilities $P(X = x,Y = y)$ summarised in the following table.

         | $x = 1$  $x = 2$  $x = 3$
--------  -------- -------- --------
$y = 1$  | 0.06     0.42     0.08
$y = 2$  | 0.04     0.28     0.12

(a) Why does the above table define a discrete random variable?
(b) What are the marginal distributions for $X$ and $Y$?
(c) Show that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **not** independent.
(d) Which two cells of the table can you switch to make $X$ and $Y$ independent?
