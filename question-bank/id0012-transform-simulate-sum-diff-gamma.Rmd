The random vector $(Y_1, Y_2~\vert~\theta) =  (X_1 + X_2, X_1 - X_2)$ where $X_{1}~\vert~\theta \sim \text{Gamma}(1/2,\theta)$ and $X_{2}~\vert~\theta \sim \text{Gamma}(1/2,\theta)$ are independent random variables, where $\theta$ is the scale parameter.

(a) Simulate from $(Y_1, Y_2~\vert~\theta=1)$ and plot the realisations. Based on this plot comment on the evidence for independence between the random variables. Calculate the correlation between $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, is it what you expect?

(b) Simulate $(Y_1, Y_2)$ from the distribution defined by $(Y_1, Y_2~\vert~\theta)$ where $\theta \sim \text{Exp}(1)$. Comment on the evidence for independence between the random variables. Calculate the correlation between $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, is it what you expect?

(c) Using part (b) approximate the marginal distribution with a kernel density estimator.
